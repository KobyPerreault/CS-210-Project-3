# CS-210-Project-3

This project was the third and final project for my CS 210 course at SNHU. The goal of this project was to create a program that would read a list of items from a .txt file and figure out how many times each item was referenced and out put this information in 3 different ways. The first was to look up a specific item. The second would show all items in the list, and the third would show all items but instead of a number, the frequency would be shown by a series of '*'s based on the frequency. Additionaly the program would write the items and their frequencies to a .dat file as a backup. This was my first time ever using maps in C++ and I feel that I've used it very effectivly
