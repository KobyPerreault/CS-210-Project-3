# CS-210-Project-3

This project was the third and final project for my CS 210 course at SNHU. The goal of this project was to create a program that would read a list of items from a .txt file and figure out how many times each item was referenced and output this information in 3 different ways. The first was to look up a specific item. The second would show all items in the list, and the third would show all items but instead of a number, the frequency would be shown by a series of '*'s based on the frequency. Additionally, the program would write the items and their frequencies to a .dat file as a backup. This was my first time ever using maps in C++ and I feel that I've used it very effectively. I do believe that there is an easier way for the data to be displayed for the second option using the .dat file that was created instead of using the looping method that I used. The most challenging part of this project was learning how to use a map effectively. I believe that I have succeeded in that way, however I'm sure that I've only scratched the surface of maps and there are probably more advanced features that I have yet to discover. I have kept the code quite easy to read and well documented with in-line comments. Using a class also helps with adaptability as if someone needs to add a new way to display the list in the future, they simply have to add-on to the class and update the switch statement and menu to reflect these additions.
